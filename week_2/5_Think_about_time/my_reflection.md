# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?




My greatest overall time management challenge in Phase 0 is getting things started early enough into the week in order to 
have time to complete all the challenges by the Sunday deadline.  I still work full time outside of this bootcamp and have to have time for my (very) pregnant fiance'.  I spend time staying up at night trying to get things completed, but that is beginning to affect my work as well as my time away from work.  It's stressful.

I will, beginning this week, make a serious commitment to getting to bed on time. I don't always have to get 8 hours of sleep, going all the way back to my military days.  Therefore, I will set my alarm to get up earlier and use that time to be more productive. I think it is a great idea, in theory, and I can't wait to put it into practice.  This will also help me in terms of dealing eith taking time from my lady, because she sleeps for as long as she can. Don't tell her I said that, I will deny it, grin.

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to go at it as hard as I can in the beginning of the week, and get as much done so I can have the rest of the week and the weekend to spend with my close ones. I think I am starting to get the hang of this, well a little.
