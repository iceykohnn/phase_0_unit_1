##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS  
  * The Elements tab allows for editing of html and css because it displays the code in that tab so you can edit it.
  * Javascript Debugging  
  * The Sources tab allows for editing Javascript in order to debug it
  * Performance Optimization 
  * We can optimize performance in the Networking tab by checking the various columns there and fixing the bottlenecks.

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
* command option I

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  * 0b0f11 is the code for the current background color.
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website?

316 kb http://www.ticketswizard.com/Images/Catalog/92624182-c482-4a35-8da2-4fbf2f502e94_Large_Large.png 
I found it in the Network tab under the size column. I narrowed the search down to images and saw which one was the largest
* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated? I don't know what you mean by the lowest hanging fruit.  But I have posted a link to a screenshot here of the analysis I made. If I were to guess what you mean, I would pick the html minify. If we minify the html we could save 1.1kb
