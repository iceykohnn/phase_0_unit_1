The DOM was a real puzzle to me, I couldn't understand it. I didn't know what they meant by the "API= DOM + JS" #soforthandso_on. I had to read over the other material provided after bloodying my wall and bandaging my forehead.  When I got to the second article, from Skillcrush, it hit me like lightning. I got it. It is a model that puts the html components into object forms so that the languages, like Javascript, can use, AS OBJECTS!  It's not that difficult, Isaac. (rubs forehead.....)

When I looked at wordpress I saw a lot of scripts there, even before the header. I couldn't read any of it, but I noted it. Also, when I looked at different elements, like the facebook like button, I saw a lot of Isaac's more confused. I assumed that the wordpress blog was a lot more complex because it was made to be a blog that people could customize and make their own, vs. my little site that I put together after a couple of days. 

Chrome Tools were awesome, I enjoyed working with them, for the most part. I had a hard time finding the CSS elements that corresponded with the Html I was looking at, but I got it eventually by messing around with things. I think this is an awesome way to edit my page because I can see it live. Awesome.

My aha moment came to me as I opened the second article about the DOM by Skillcrush.  They really did a better job of explaining the DOM than the first article did. 

I saw a youtube posting that had an illustration of the DOM which helped.  The narrator talked really slow, and gave some information repeatedly, but I liked the diagram he used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ZcldkGlt8
