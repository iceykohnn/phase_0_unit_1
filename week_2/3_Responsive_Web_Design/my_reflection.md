# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I believe responsive web design is creating html for our pages that can be used efficiently across a variety of browsers that use different parameters for viewing pages. I think it's a great idea because we want to create content for many different people to view no matter which browser they use. It's thinking of our users instead of just doing what we want. 

Smartphones and tablets have changed the way everything was done in terms of how we display pages and content. It is like my former teacher and mentor used to say, "We need to invest in loss. Starting over and becoming a student again is necessary to continue to grow." Well, sometimes. If new tech comes along, I would hope we would be smart enough to come to an agreement on what we will go forward with so we can all work together instead of in spite of each other. Ideally. 

I think visually impaired people would have to use their other senses to access the web.  Maybe there is a reader program that could read what is on the screen. Of course there should be design implemented toward helping the visually impaired. They are human beings and worthy of our everything like everyone else.

I think I resonate more toward the html aspect of Html.  I like the organization of everything.  Designing and putting things into css is more tedious for me.  But I like knowing it so that I can control the outcome of my work. But it is tedious. What doesn't make sense is that we do things so differently with different browsers and the like. I think that innovation should be rewarded, but redundant work for anyone that wants to contribute content to the general world seems stupid.  Why isn't there a general coding format that reigns at the top until something better comes along and can be voted into position? Meh.

I looked up this site to answer the questions about the visually impaired:
