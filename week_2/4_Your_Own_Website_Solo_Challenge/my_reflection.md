Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that design and user experience are very important parts of development for the web.  I also learned that implementing them is not as easy as it seems. I can get the process going in my head, just fine, but I run into problems connecting the css to the html. But I do understand that it's what make a good page great, and mediocre pages mediocre.

Honestly, I don't think that it's for me. I might change my mind later if I discover a good program that makes it easy to put together what you envision.  But doing it all by hand in code, it just seems like there are too many things that can go wrong, and I can put more time to it later. 

I thought about what I wanted my site to look like, and be laid out. I knew the pictures that I wanted to use, and where I wanted them to be. I set up my divs, classes and content in my html, and proceeded to the css.  I followed my learnings from the slides, and tried to see it materialize, but it fizzled. I tried many different things like fixing my syntax, changing the names of my divs, putting things in lower-case, etc. But it didn't work out the way I wanted it to look.

I would like to change the size of my image, I would like to put a caption on it, using absolute positioning and the z axis, I would love it if the colors would layer like my last tech blog did.

I found it extremely difficult, which is highly disappointing. I just know that I am going to turn this is, go back and look up something that will make total sense that I missed and /facepalm. 

Because it was the solo challenge, I couldn't look anything up on this one.
