# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think web standards are necessary.  If we don't have them then we need to make major changes to our pages, just so that others can see them.  If we all work from the same set of standards, then it makes creating, changing and viewing content easier. They are definitely good.

The standard structure is easy for me because it makes sense.  If I put this tag here, then I will fill it with something that is described by the tag.  It is a great way of organizing html, and my thoughts, actually. 

I like some of the new Html5 elements, because they make sense. They make some of the tags easier to understand and use, like header and footer.  But the section tags confuse me, after learning the previous standards.  It seems like they are repeating themselves. I don't know.

reset.css is necessary to blow away the standards of the different browsers, so that the user experience can be the same on all browsers. We want to view the page in the same way on every browser. 

I have used Safari, Firefox and Chrome thus far. I think it is good for different companies to have different browsers and capabilities.  While I think standards are better to have us all working together, I can appreciate the diversity. Not everyone thinks like me.

I din't find any extra resources.
