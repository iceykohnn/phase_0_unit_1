Hey all,

  This is Isaac. Isaac Keith.  You know, from your accountability group? Yah, that guy.  Thanks for being in my group, if there is anything that I can do, let me know. 
Ok! Here is the info requested from section 7.  Oh, and thanks Jon, for the email you sent me first, it made this one easier to write. 
My favorite websites are mangareader.net, skill-capped.com, and fitpregnancy.com. Well, right now, anyway.  I love mangareader because my nephew reads manga on there, and I want to always be able to relate to him.  To be honest, those comics are really funny sometimes. Skill-capped is more of a personal thing. I love playing WoW, and it helps make me play better. Fitpregnancy is all about the family. I will be a dad soon, and taking care of mama-san is a must.  My learning style is kinesthetic, then auditory and visual.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 



I read Jon's response, even though it is from week two, not this week. I can understand how he feels, I'm scared too. I feel a sense of connection, and a little better to knkow that we are kinda in the same boat. This week has had it's ups and downs, but I feel much more excited by the end of this week one than I did at the start. i amm so glad to be here, and to be given the chance to change my stars like this. I have two of the best reasons in the world to be taking this challenge on and to be successful.
