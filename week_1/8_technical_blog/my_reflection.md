## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I finished this exercise and looked back on it with appreciation. I have never had a blog before. I must have always thought it was too difficult, but now I know better. This isn't so bad.  I like the idea of having somewhere to put my thoughts, and letting others come see them. Thanks for that, grin.
