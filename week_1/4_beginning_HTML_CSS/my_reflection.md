## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Html makes sense to me overall, as it seems like it is a great tool for organizing and setting up content. All I have to do, so far is open the tag for the elements that I want to use, and make sure I close that tag.  I can put things where I want them, and set them up the way I want them.  There are a couple of things that I need to make sure go on the page at the top and the bottom, but I can just kinda understand that as a greeting to the machine/browser that I am using. We are having a conversation, and that is just how I start it off.

Honestly, I think it's all good. Once we learn how to use it, I'm sure it will grow far more complicated, but it basically seems like a tool to set up and present our content. I am interested in seeing the source code for some of my favorite pages. 

I solidified my understanding on Html concerning the ids and classes. I really didn't get it at first, how we would se the id vs. the class. But I get it now. 

I actually gained a greater understanding from my brother. I called him and asked him to go over some of the things I was hazy on.
