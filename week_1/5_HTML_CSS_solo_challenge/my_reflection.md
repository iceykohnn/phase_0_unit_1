I couldn't ask any questions, because it was a solo challenge, but I wondered how I was going to comment out my pseudo code at the bottom. I had forgotten how to comment out in Html because I was nervous. I did look that up on Google becaue it was syntax related.

I really don't know how to get the CSS to come over completely. I can get it to align or change size, but my colors didn't come over on the solo challenge. I am really bummed about that.

I did learn how to comment out in html.

I blew it. I really blew it. I'm not confident at all. 

I really enjoyed the excitement of getting this page up, because of the content and the way I wanted to do it. I was trying to put a picture of my girl up and it was about my family. I feel really let down now, like I let them down.

I didn't get the pseudo links at all. Not at all. I really hope week two goes better.
