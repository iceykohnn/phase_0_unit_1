I learned what DNS meant. i was always curious, but it seemed above me.  Now I know that it is referring to Domain name servers. And that isn't hard at all. I learned that there are multiple servers (massive computers) that only have information linking ip addresses and the domain names that we so very much need to know where we are going on the Internet.

Some inportant things to remember about setting up my HTML site are to verify/remember the proper IP address that I am given by my registrar.  I can really make myself miserable if I link my newly purchased domain name to an incorrect IP address. Also, there is a 24 hour delay in changing my domain/IP address information.  So yah, get it right and don't switch it around if you're impatient.

I was kinda verklempt. I choked up a lil bit, to be honest. I have never done that before, and it feels good to follow directions and see how easy things can be, no matter how much you might have thought it above you.

I solidified my knowledge about domain names vs. IP addresses.  I really didn't understand them and now I kinda feel like I do.

I actually followed the articles given to me by DBC. I'm good. I'm good.
