## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that proper design is important not only for the user's satisfaction but as a prepartion tool, proper design thinking can save time, work and effort. Very important.

I liked thinking a little differently than I normally do. I had a purpose with this thinking, and it allowed me to become my user a little, so that I could scuplt the end experience for them. Fun.

"What tools can I use to help me wireframe?" I searched the articles given to us and I located wirify.com. Excellent tool,quick and easy, and fun. I also looked on Google+ for some of the challenges that my cohort buddies posted and how they overcame them.

I had absolutely no idea how to upload my images to an image sharing site. Nailbiter, I know. I came across a site that I have been to many times to laugh at, Imgur.  I am looking at Imgur comepletely different now, from the standpoint of utility and not just entertainment. 

I started using keystrokes much more starting with this challenge. Command+s for save, Command+M for minimize window, etc. I am feeling my groove a little bit, knock on wood. 

I rather enjoyed the creating a wireframe html page aspect.  I used to be someone different, doing only what it took to get by on homework and the like, but this time I was pretty excited to use what I have learned in making that html page a little better. I added a link to each page on there, and I threw in a css file to turn the questions font to red to make them more easily distinguishable. Making classes and using span tags, look at me! Grin!

Honestly, I thought making the wireframe image was going to be tedious, not to mention incorrect. I was agonizing over it, this entire time. But I found some software that helped me, Wirify, and it was a breeze. I am so excited to try to find more technology out there that I can use. Feels really good to get this done and be happy with my work!
