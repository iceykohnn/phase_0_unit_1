## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Ok so, this how to create a repositority or repo. First, we have to login to github.  Once we've logged in, we 4 boxes/links on the home page.  These are the links/tutorials letting us know what are the 4 major steps of using github are.  We want to look under these for the green button that says "new repository". Click on that.  It will take you on a page that says your username in a box with your picture next to it. There will be a / and then another box, this one empty. you must name your repo here. In the description, you can give a brief explanation about what you plan to use this repo for. Click the public spot, so anyone can see it.  Also, check the box to add a README so you can give any instructions, descriptions, help, license names, etc. You can also choose the types of licenses you wish to use for this content from the dropdown menu. 

Open Source basically means just that. Open meaning it can be accessed by anyone, and source meaning source code. Anyone can view the source code behind the software. We can go into more detail, like whether devs can add, remove, edit, or modify the source code to suit their whims.

Open source makes me smile. When people share their code, we all benefit.  Imagine where we would be if the majority of our code was open for public viewing? Anyone/everyone (developers) could add their creativity to almost any project. We could all learn more from each other geodesically. Utopia indeed. We could create cleaner, more creative, efficient, clearer code. 

Licenses are paramount. We need them to keep us honest, and maintain control over the good code we bring to the forefront. Credit should be given where it is due.Keeping that control in the hands of the developer keeps them motivated to create more things, for whatever reward they envision. Licenses allow them to keep that motivation.


The challenge was pretty straightforward.  I was puzzled by the enforced naming of the repo.  "You must, must, must name your projcet username..." Just to test out if the world would end, I made another repo and named it my twin brother's nickname.  Nobody died, grin, so I postulated that this assignment wanted that name for another reason, possibly ease of locating it for other students later on. (HA!)

I didn't find any other resources for this challenge. I only used the articles provided by DBC.
