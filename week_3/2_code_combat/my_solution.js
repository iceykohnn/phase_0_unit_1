// Reflection:
// Write your reflection here.

// The code combat idea, website and game are all brilliant. I had a lot of fun playing and figuring out how 
// much work actually goes into all of my video games.  Also, it felt good to get away, even if not really, 
// from the normal thougt pattern of coding.  I enjoyed seeing what I was doing, and at the same time playing 
// as the time wizard on my little floating cloud. Whe I play games, I usually approach them so instinctively, 
// never really putting much thought into how much code went into defining the movements, and the strategy of 
// how many different ways the game could be played. The mission where I had to get the mushroom power up before
// I could kill the enemy, was fun, but the one where I had to taunt the guard, and get him to line up so my 
// archer could shoot him was the tough one. I was stuck on that one trying to get by the last two guards....
